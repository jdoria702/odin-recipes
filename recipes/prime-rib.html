        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          If you've ever carved into a <em>prime rib</em> at a big holiday meal
          expecting a juicy, perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry,
          overcooked roast, this recipe is for you. Here are some tips from Chef
          John to get you started:
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="ingredients">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 lbs bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
          <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
          <li>1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>1 tsp herbes de Prevence</li>
          <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Gather the ingredients. Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring
            to room temperature, 2 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F
            (260 degrees C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until
            well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season
            roast generously with kosher salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. (If
            your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact
            weight times 5 minutes.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door
            closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.
          </li>
          <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
